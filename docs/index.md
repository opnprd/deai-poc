This static microsite presents the results of some proof of concept work carried out whilst exploring
the [Digitisation of EIA](https://odileeds.org/projects/digital-eia/).

The proofs-of-concept included are outlined below.

## Data Driven Reporting

The production of a digital report, including interactive mapping, using configuration and
standard web technologies.

Data is stored on an accessible server in a pre-canned format, and the (static) site renders
the report. The report is defined in a JSON format.

Follow on ideas include:

* User-friendly editor for report files.
* Tool to collate datasets
