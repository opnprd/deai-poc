title: Notes on the MapBox implementation
---

This is a very trivial example of implementing a Digital ES in a [MapBox Storytelling template](https://github.com/mapbox/storytelling).

Data needs to be loaded into MapBox Studio into either a tileset if not to be edited, or as a dataset if needs editing edited. Can also create directly in studio

Datasets ultimately need to be converted to tilesets, and can then be added to Styles.

Layers within styles can be filtered from tilesets based on attributes, meaning it is possible to separately highlight 

MapBox has an excellent starter set of data, and it is possible to publish pre-canned tilesets. Critical baseline data
could be thus presented.

As a javascript-based site, it can be overlaid with additional behaviours.
